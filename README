# CCEL - Common Communication Event Layer

CCEL provides a variant set of effective network-apis and udev binding implemented under Boost.It uses a managed handler pool to achieve memory management(using Boost.object_pool),and suppords function hooking through handlers. 

## Protocols that supported

+ TCP
+ UDP
+ HTTP
+ CANBus (SocketCAN,CAN over TCP/IP Protocols,CAN over Serial)
+ ModBus (Through TCP/UDP,Serial)

## Usage

Include "ccel/ccel.hpp" for all protocols or includes sperated headers for exact functions.
You can also use ccel/udev.hpp to handle user-space devices (like uinput)

## Progress

Works need to be done,and some needs to refatrory
